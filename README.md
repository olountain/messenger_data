# messenger_data
My attempt at creating an app that displays analysis of messenger data from group chats containing various combinations of a select group. Displays number of messages over time by group chat and by sender, most commonly sent words*, and total message counts.

*Most commonly used words section needs some work to decipher unusual characters.

App available at vast-wildwood-24400.herokuapp.com.
